# Card_Trick_Game

This is my final C++ program that I submitted for my Object Oriented Programming class. This project exceeded the expectations of my professor so much, that he decided to give me extra credit.

This program simulates a card trick game by creating a random deck of cards and askes the user to pick a card. After the user picks their card, the program will use an algorithm that will deal the cards out, pick them up, and determine the card the the user has chosen.
